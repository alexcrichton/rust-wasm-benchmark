# Rust Wasm Benchmark

This repo contains some simple benchmarks between handwritten web assembly,
wasm-bindgen, and stdweb compilations. The current benchmarks are primarily
tailored to benchmark the overhead of function calls between JS and wasm.

**This repository is not a general-purpose benchmark between wasm-bindgen and
stdweb**
